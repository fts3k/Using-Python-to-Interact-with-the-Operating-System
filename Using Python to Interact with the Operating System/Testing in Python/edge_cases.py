# We may give our code input that we don't want it to run into under normal operations.

# e.g what will happen to our function if we give it an empty string.

# EDGE CASES - inputs to our code that produce unexpected results, and are found at the extreme ends of the ranges of input we imagine our programs will typically work with.

# Edge cases need special handling in order for our code to behave correctly.
